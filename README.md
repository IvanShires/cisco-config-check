## cisco config check

basically to see how feasible using ciscoconfparse is to do random things.. think, making sure vlan1 addr's exist... interface entries, ACLs are there (or not), stuff like that...

this is using cisco DevNet's stuff - big thanks to cisco for providing that. that is really helpful
